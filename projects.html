            <li><strong>Chatbot for College Admission:</strong> This chatbot is designed to assist users with inquiries about D. Y. Patil College of Engineering & Technology using a text-based knowledge base. It employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to correct spelling and grammar, filter out stopwords, and focus on main keywords while answering user questions. The chatbot processes user queries, matches them with relevant sentences from a provided text file, and returns responses based on the identified matches. It is interactive, continually improving user experience by offering informative answers based on the content of the text data, even if just one word from the user's query aligns with the knowledge base.</li>

            <li><strong>Dress Code Detection System:</strong> I completed an image classification project utilizing deep learning techniques, which aimed to predict whether students are wearing a uniform based on provided images. The project involved the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset, consisting of images of students both in and out of uniform, was used to train and validate the model. Data augmentation techniques, such as random flips, rotations, and zooming, were applied to increase the dataset's diversity. The model, trained over ten epochs, achieved high accuracy and was saved for future use. Additionally, I implemented a function to predict whether a student is wearing a uniform by providing a URL to an image. The project demonstrates my proficiency in deep learning, image processing, and model deployment for real-world applications.</li>

            <li><strong>Dropshipping Recommendation System:</strong> Leveraging machine learning, I created a recommendation system for dropshipping businesses. This system helps online retailers make data-driven decisions by suggesting the best products to offer based on market trends and customer preferences.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Virtual Assistant:</strong> I developed a virtual assistant that streamlines everyday tasks, making life more convenient. This project involved natural language processing (NLP) techniques and demonstrated my ability to create intelligent systems that respond to user commands.</li>
